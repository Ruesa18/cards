# Cards
The new open source learning software. Learn your school topics by using learning cards.

## Run
Both parts of this software (frontend and backend) can be started locally as docker containers via [dde](https://github.com/whatwedo/dde).
After installation you can run `dde exec` from inside either `backend/` or `frontend/` and it will start a docker container with your application in it.
For more infos on how to install and run the application consult the dedicated README.
